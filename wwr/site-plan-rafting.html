      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        At Lorem Ipsum Whitewater Rafting, we want to make whitewater rafting
        accessible to everyone- not just elite adrenaline junkies and
        thrill-seekers. We seek to create adventures and outings that the whole
        family can enjoy- to foster bonds and relationships among the people we
        love the most. We explore beautiful nature and provide wonderful
        experiences so that the memories made will indeed last a lifetime.
      </p>
      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        At Lorem Ipsum Whitewater Rafting, our target audience is families-
        people who come from everyday walks of life and who are looking to make
        memories. Ideally, we'd look for ages 5-105 and be able to accommodate a
        broad range of abilities and comfort levels. We serve a broad base of
        clients and want to be welcoming of everyone and those with a variety of
        skill/experience levels. While we can take seasoned rafters on an
        adventure, they will most likely find ours to be too tame for them- we
        want families to enjoy the outdoors and feel safe and well-cared for as
        they do so. Families represent a large demographic, and many companies
        do not cater their offerings to them- focusing on solo or team
        activities that are high-octane adventures. We want to do more than
        provide families with a nice day or a place to have a picnic. Amusement
        parks are often attractive for families due to a wide variety of
        interests and experiences- and we believe the ultimate amusement park is
        the great outdoors. By having an eye-catching and easy-to-navigate
        website, a solid presence on social media, and an Instagram page where
        customers can tag and post their images; we hope to engage our target
        audience in a way that feels familiar but also exciting and relevant to
        current expectations. Our website will have various sections- what's
        new, FAQs, testimonials, and about sections so people can find
        information easily and quickly.
