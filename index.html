        Hello! My name is Paige Emmett and I am from Cheyenne, Wyoming. I love
        listening to music, woodworking, playing games, and reading mystery
        novels. I am a student of BYU-I and am studying Software Development. I
        really enjoy learning new things and working hard to improve myself.

        Wyoming is a state in the Western United States. It borders Montana to
        the north and northwest, South Dakota and Nebraska to the east, Idaho to
        the west, Utah to the southwest, and Colorado to the south. Wyoming is
        the least populous state despite being the 10th largest by area, and the
        state capital is Cheyenne, which is one of three state capitals with an
        indigenous name in a state with an indigenous name.
